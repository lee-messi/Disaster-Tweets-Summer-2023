# Classify Disaster Tweets
These are the notebooks that I worked on for [the Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started). As of July 24th, 2023, the best performing model has the score of 0.83971 (Rank: 93). Note that, given the unique nature of this competition, the top 40 - 50 entries have perfect scores. 

## Tensorflow Models (via Tensorflow Hub)
* **BERT-based Classifier**: We train three different models using BERT and achieve ~78% validation accuracy. This is not impressive compared to the performance of other models that are on the leaderboard.
    * Score: 0.79742; Rank: 528; Submission on: July 20th, 2023

* **BERT + LSTMs**: We train two additional models using Bi-directional LSTMs and achieve ~80% validation accuracy. This is a small improvement from the first set of models. We did not submit predictions using these models.

## BERTweet (via Hugging Face)
* **BERTweet V1**: We fine-tune a Hugging Face model (BERTweet) that has been trained on Twitter data and achieve ~83% validation accuracy. This is a considerable improvement from the first set of models and ranked moderately high on the leaderboard.
    * Score: 0.83971; Rank: 93; Submission on: July 26th, 2023

* **BERTweet V2**: We fine-tune the same Hugging Face model (BERTweet) alongside an early-stopping callback. The model achieved ~82% validation accuracy. This was not a significant improvement from the other BERTweet model, so we did not submit predictions of this model.

* **BERTweet V3**: We fine-tune the same Hugging Face model (BERTweet) and perform the same pre-processing steps that had been used prior to training the BERTweet model. The model achieved ~81% validation accuracy. This was not a significant improvement from the other BERTweet model. 
    * Score: 0.82623; Rank: Unranked; Submission on: Aug 8th, 2023

## DistilBERT (via Hugging Face)
* **DistilBERT V1**: We fine-tune DistilBERT from Hugging Face and perform the set of pre-processing steps identified in the BERTweet notebooks prior to training the model. The model achieved ~84% validation accuracy. This was a significant improvement from the previous models, but the model did not perform better on the test data set.
    * Score: 0.82255; Rank: Unranked; Submission on: Aug 15th, 2023

## DeBERTa (via Hugging Face)
* **DeBERTa V1**: We fine-tune DeBERTa from Hugging Face and perform the set of pre-processing steps identified in the BERTweet notebooks prior to training the model. The model achieved ~82% validation accuracy. This was not a significant improvement from the previous models, and the model did not perform better on the test data set.
    * Score: 0.81642; Rank: Unranked; Submission on: Aug 16th, 2023
